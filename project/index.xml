      <description>This project will develop a prototype, responsive and visually simple website that can help newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers navigate the complexities of settlement in Australia and connect to communities.
As part of the team I was in charge of extracting information from different data sources, which also involved diverse formats like CSV, plain text and JSON. Also I implemented an API in Python Flask that was used to query and return information from our consolidated data source.</description>

      <title>Angular 2 Hack (hosted by General Assembly &amp; SSW)</title>

      <description>I participated in this half-a-day crash-course hosted by General Assembly to learn the basics on Angular 2. Given that what-to-wear was a personal project already running in AngularJS, me and my friend Mardi decided to work towards starting its migration to Angular 2. We struggled a bit to make it work and reducing dependencies towards using PHP (which set the basis for developing the what-to-wear API project).
We ended up sharing the top prize as shown here.</description>

      <description>Random Hacks of Kindness is &amp;ldquo;a community of technologists who solve problems for purpose driven organisations&amp;rdquo;. In the Winter 2016 2-day hackaton, I joined the team &amp;ldquo;Changing Places&amp;rdquo;, which had the following tasks:
 completing their WordPress website; and, proposing new ways for users to interact with them.  I got involved in the second task, and proposed different approaches for fast communication under the assumption that many carers carry a smart phone with them.</description>

      <description>what-to-wear is an application with the purpose of storing my clothes and when I use them. It is comprised of a frontend developed in HTML, AngularJS and JavaScript (available on request), and a backend API in Python Flask.
While it is mostly a log application with the idea of developing different skills, my idea is to extend this to implement machine learning services like proactively suggesting what garments to wear at a given day.</description>

      <description>The Sensis Ontology Program is an enabler for richer classification of Business, Government and Geospatial content and data across Sensis which aims to move classification away from manually managed printed books into automated digital clusters of terms, concepts and categories. The Ontology Program is designed to assist in providing fresher, more accurate and deeper content (e.g., Brands and Products) for listing retrieval via the Sensis Search API, as well as supporting data for business intelligence and data science teams.</description>
