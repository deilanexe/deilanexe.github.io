  <h3>Interests</h3>
</div>
  About my area of research, I am
  interested in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Ontology Construction,
  Agent Systems, Software Engineering and Conversational Systems. My working
  experience has also permitted me to learn Agile methodologies of software
  development, API and front-end development, some data science principles (data
  extraction and manipulation) and machine learning.

  <br>
  When coding is required, my current choice of a programming language is Python.
  However, I can also produce code in JavaScript, Java, R, and, if you ask nicely,
  C.
  <br />
  I have practical experience in both SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
  and noSQL (MongoDB, Solr, ElasticSearch).
  <br>
  I have recently taken interest in hackatons, particularly participating in
  <a href="http://www.rhokaustralia.org/#welcome">
  Random Hacks of Kindness</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.govhack.org/">GovHack</a>.
