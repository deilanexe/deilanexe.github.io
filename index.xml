      <title>Final Fantasy XV completed (and some comments about it)</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Today, apparently after 70 hours, I finished Final Fantasy XV. While I enjoyed
the game at many stages, I got to the last episodes with an urge to finish it.
There were still some side quests and things to do, but I felt like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
bother. Fortunately, not everything was bad, as I went through 70+ hours of
game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have enjoyed early Final Fantasy games, from the SNES FFIV, FFV
and FFVI (the best of the series to me!), Tactics in PSX, FFVIII in my PC, PSP
remakes of FFI and FFII, and FFIX, to the Dissidia series (even though Duodecim
was just an &amp;ldquo;expansion&amp;rdquo; of the original).However, since completing IX, just
tried playing X without success and then skipped the rest of the series until
this one (I have XIII in my PC but wasn&amp;rsquo;t a huge fan of Lightning since
Dissidia). So to me, this was like my comeback to the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it any good to come back to Final Fantasy? Here are my comments (spoiler
alert!):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-liked&#34;&gt;What I liked&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The antagonist. While not even close to Kefka Palazzo, he was a really good
rival to Noctis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sense of progression of most of the characters&amp;rsquo; personalities. This is a
common topic in Final Fantasy games, and it&amp;rsquo;s good it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been lost yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world! It&amp;rsquo;s stunning and beautiful, and at some point I was only taking
photos while driving around Eos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to play music from past Final Fantasy games, including arranges
for the Dissidia games. I also liked the music in-game, but I was not a fan of
the &amp;ldquo;Stand by me&amp;rdquo; cover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-could-be-better&#34;&gt;What could be better&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Characters. For most of the game (until the late stages) I was annoyed by
the secondary characters, but most by Prompto in particular. This might be
related to me perceiving the game as trying to appeal US gamers, which I mention
below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Story. There was not much side story for the secondary characters, which felt
strange in a series that has dealt with 16+ main characters (cf. FFVI). Also, at
the start of the final chapter, Talcott (the boy who collects Cactuars) makes
a recollection of the fate of some secondary characters, but they do not appear!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Open&amp;rdquo; world. This was the biggest flaw to me, and I&amp;rsquo;ll use The Witcher 3 as
a comparison. Maybe the world was smaller in the latter game, but I was riding
Roach and it was easy for me to get off and defeat some monsters along the way.
On the other hand, the Regalia made me lazy to wander around and get off of it
(or maybe it was sometimes slower to get out and in of the car). Chocobos were
not different enough for me to prefer them over the car (you cannot cross
mountains!). Eos, while beautiful, is also very lonely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voices selection. The game overall felt like an adaptation to appeal Western
audiences, and particularly those from the US. English voices and US slang felt
over-abused to me, ruining even some of the characters&amp;rsquo; personalities (mostly
Cindy, and the Chocobo Races guy&amp;hellip; &amp;ldquo;Y&amp;rsquo;re all here to ride?&amp;rdquo;). While I preferred
Japanese voices, they were not very useful while trying to get around and
reading subtitles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ending. After all the excitement of the battles&amp;hellip; it was plainly sad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;would-i-play-it-again&#34;&gt;Would I play it again?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing that I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do is to defeat the Adamantoise, and maybe try
the mansion. But I will not try the upcoming character expansions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This project will develop a prototype, responsive and visually simple website
that can help newly arrived migrants, refugees and asylum seekers navigate the
complexities of settlement in Australia and connect to communities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the team I was in charge of extracting information from different
data sources, which also involved diverse formats like CSV, plain text and JSON.
Also I implemented an API in Python Flask that was used to query and return
information from our consolidated data source. I was also involved, to a minor
degree, with the UI that was used for the final prototype. The code I developed
is shared through my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/deilanexe/govhack-mole-api&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Angular 2 Hack (hosted by General Assembly &amp; SSW)</title>
      <link>https://deilanexe.github.io/project/angular_2_hack/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://deilanexe.github.io/project/angular_2_hack/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I participated in this half-a-day crash-course hosted by General Assembly to
learn the basics on Angular 2. Given that &lt;em&gt;what-to-wear&lt;/em&gt; was a personal project
already running in AngularJS, me and my friend
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ma-al.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mardi&lt;/a&gt; decided to work towards
starting its migration to Angular 2. We struggled a bit to make it work and
reducing dependencies towards using PHP (which set the basis for developing
the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/deilanexe/what-to-wear-api&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;what-to-wear API&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up sharing the top prize as shown
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SSW_TV/status/784639225434107904&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RHoK: Changing Places (Jun 2016)</title>
      <link>https://deilanexe.github.io/project/rhok__jun_2016/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rhokaustralia.org/#welcome&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;a
community of technologists who solve problems for purpose driven organisations&amp;rdquo;.
In the Winter 2016 2-day hackaton, I joined the team
&lt;a href=&#34;http://changingplaces.org.au/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Changing Places&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which had the following
tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;completing their WordPress website; and,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proposing new ways for users to interact with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got involved in the second task, and proposed different approaches for fast
communication under the assumption that many carers carry a smart phone with
them. The proposal used Twitter, as well as QR codes to enable such channels.
Our team was the winner team of the hackaton. Proof of our achievement is

      <title>what-to-wear</title>
      <link>https://deilanexe.github.io/project/what-to-wear/</link>

      <guid>https://deilanexe.github.io/project/what-to-wear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;what-to-wear&lt;/em&gt; is an application with the purpose of storing my clothes and when
I use them. It is comprised of a frontend developed in HTML, AngularJS and
JavaScript (available on request), and a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/deilanexe/what-to-wear-api&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;backend API in Python Flask&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is mostly a log application with the idea of developing different
skills, my idea is to extend this to implement
machine learning services like proactively suggesting what garments to wear at
a given day.&lt;/p&gt;
